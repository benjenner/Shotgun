## School Project: Automatic Opponent Game

For this school project, I created a game where you play against an automated opponent. The goal is to shoot your opponent while they load. Both players start without any shots and must "Load" to get ammunition. If you collect three shots, you can use "Shotgun" to win instantly.

In the game, players' actions determine the outcomes: loading, blocking, or shooting lead to different results, creating a simple yet strategic logic.

### Key Requirements

- The code must be OOP and the game should run smoothly
- Optimizing the automated opponent's intelligence based on game logic
- Providing an option to play again
- Allowing "Shotgun" only if a player has at least three shots
