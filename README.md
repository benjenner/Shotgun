## Project Overview

The project involved creating a user-friendly application and database to manage bookings for a fictional hotel or guesthouse. (There were, unfortunately, no extra points awarded for coming up with a clever name for the hotel.)

The application handles:
- Room management (single and double rooms)
- Customer registration and updates
- Bookings (including search and prevention of double bookings)
- Cancellation and modification of bookings
- Payment handling

### Technical Requirements

The technical requirements include:
- Entity Framework for database interactions
- Implementing code first approach in Entity Framework
- Ensuring the solution is OOP and functions without errors
- Using Windows Forms for the interface
